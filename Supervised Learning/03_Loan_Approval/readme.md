## 🔍 Overview

This project is an end-to-end **Loan Approval Prediction System** that predicts whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant data. It uses **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers trained on historical loan application data.

Built with:
- **Scikit-learn** for training and evaluation
- **Streamlit** for UI/UX
- Clean and modern frontend with integrated real-time ML predictions

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time loan prediction  
- ✅ Beautiful, interactive UI with Streamlit  
- ✅ Handles missing values, one-hot encoding, and scaling  
- ✅ Balanced metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score: 0.91)  
- ✅ Easily extendable and customizable
